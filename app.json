  [ "Put your Mono on the fridge and keep track of the small mundane tasks that have to be done once in a while."
  , "Mono will display an icon for each task and display how long since you or someone else did the task. Touching the number will reset the count."
  , "You can display up to three tasks on the screen. To replace a task with another task, click on the icon you want to replace, and the row switches to a list of all available icons, which you can now browse through, and click to select."
